# Dust
Stuff this bot does:
* Posts when a new Dustforce stream goes live to the Dustforce discord.
* Posts when a world record is broken on the Dustforce leaderboards to twitter. https://twitter.com/dustforceILs
* Adds a replay preview when somebody links a Dustforce replay with various data such as time, score, etc.
* Posts to the Dustforce discord when somebody breaks into a top 10 place on any of the stock maps.

Huge thanks to https://github.com/msg555 who helped me figure out how to use the Dustforce API, Lifeformed (Dustforce dev) for adding new stuff to the API to make things easier for me, https://github.com/Angrevol for just general help when I had trouble with figuring something out in node.js, and https://github.com/CoreyByrne for helping refactor code a bit.
